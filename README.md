Hi! I'm Eric, and I am a Full Stack Developer. I graduated from California State University Fullerton with a B.S in Computer Science. My initial focus after graduating was in the game development industry, but I later realized I found more enjoyment in web development. I have attended LearningFuze's web development boot camp and learned valuable skills in front-end and back-end technologies like React and Node. I am currently looking for opportunities in Web Development!
